****  Tic-Tac-Toe Game  ****


The Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces mostly in a 3x3 grid.Tic-tac-toe game that is traditionally played by using pen and paper can also be played on a computer. It is a simple two-player game, if played optimally by both players the result will be a tie. The game is also called noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.


As it is common, in the proposed system we implemented an NxN grid. The user can the select grid size from 3 to 8. Because if we enter size less than or equal to 2 the game will become invalid and if enter more 8 then screen fitting might be a problem. We also implemented game mode as a choice for the user to select. Game mode is of two types, player vs player and player vs computer.
